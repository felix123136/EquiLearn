            <p>
                Baktify was founded in 2010 by a group of music enthusiasts who
                wanted to create a one-stop-shop for all things music. From our
                humble beginnings as a small record store in Jakarta, we have grown
                to become a leading music retailer in Indonesia, with outlets across
                the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have always been dedicated to bringing the best selection of
                music to our customers, and we are constantly expanding our range to
                include the latest releases and hottest trends in the music
                industry.
